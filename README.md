# rLauncher

Keyboard-based launcher app for Android. Type to filter the list of apps, and
when only one app matches the query, it will be launched automatically.

rLauncher requires no permissions, and has an APK size of < 1MB. There is no
support for widgets or wallpapers, it does one thing: launch apps.
